        <p>
          Think of your closest friends. They're the ones who make you laugh
          until your sides ache, who listen patiently to your wildest ideas, and
          who celebrate your successes like their own. They're also the ones who
          challenge you to think outside the box, who push you to step outside
          your comfort zone, and who inspire you to see the world in new and
          unexpected ways.
